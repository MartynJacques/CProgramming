To get last whitespace, we need to iterate over the whole buffer because when
we copy, we only keep track of new characters being added to the buffer,
and the last whitespace may in fact live in the copied part.

When looking for last whitespace, if it's at the start of the line, we just
want to print the whole line, or else we'll get an empty line, so just
loop until the second to last char.

When we see a newline, we want to print the whole line, but don't print the
new line character or esle we'll get two new lines

A tab stop occurs when position % TAB_STOP == 0, so when expanding a tab,
continue adding spaces until that's true, OR if we hit the end of the line,
then lets break on this, so print the buffer, and start from the beginning
